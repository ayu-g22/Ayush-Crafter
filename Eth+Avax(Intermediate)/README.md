### Summary for README

This Solidity smart contract, `errorhandling`, showcases three different ways to handle errors in Solidity: `require`, `revert`, and `assert`. The contract features a public variable `count`, starting at `0`, which only increment if specific conditions are met. Each function take an `amount` parameter and increases `count` if `amount` is greater than 200. If not, the transaction is reverted using different error handling techniques:

- **`testRequire` Function**: Utilizes `require` to check the condition. If the condition fail, it stops the transaction with a clear error message.
- **`testRevert` Function**: Uses an `if` statement combined with `revert` to validate the condition and revert the transaction with an error message if the condition fail.
- **`testAssert` Function**: Employs `assert` to ensure the condition is met. If the condition fail, it halts the transaction, signaling a serious error or bug, but does not provide an error message.

This contract serves as a straightforward example of how to manage errors and enforce conditions in Solidity smart contracts, helping developers understand the practical applications of these mechanisms.
